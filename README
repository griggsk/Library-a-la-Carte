########################### Library a la Carte Installation Instructions ##############################################

 (If you or upgrading please see the upgrading documentation that follows.)
  
Step 1. Create the Databases.

	1.1 Create the following databases in MySQL:
	
	    alacarte_development
	    alacarte_test
	    alacarte_production 
	    
	    (Be sure to use those names -or whichever names you choose in database.yml)
	
	1.2 Edit the file config/database.yml.example
	
	Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and edit to reflect your mysql databases and database settings.
	 Verify that the names for database in database.yml match the databases you created in step 1.1
	
	1.3 In the root directory of your application, run the following command:
	
	    rake db:migrate
	    This will run the initial migration to populate alacarte_development.
	    Unless Library a la Carte is run in production mode the application uses the development database.
	    
	    OPTIONAL
	    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production 
	    This will run the initial migration to populate alacarte_production
	    
	    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test 
	    This will run the initial migration to populate alacarte_test
	
	You *should* see messages scrolling by indicating tables have been created.
    If you have any errors in your DB, you will see them now.

Step 2. Configure Environments Variables

	Open the configuration folder: config/
	
	2.1 Add Action Mailer variables
	
	 edit config/initializers/smpt_settings.rb
	
	 You will need to specify some additional configuration to tell ActionMailer which server will handle your outgoing e-mail.
	
	2.2 API Keys
	
	edit config/initializers/api_settings.rb
	
	Recapcha:
	Add your recaptcha API keys to the #recaptcha variables section
	
	Google:
	Add your Google API key to the #goggle variables section
	
	edit config/flick.yml
	
	Flickr Keys
	Add your flickr api keys to the yml file. 
	Be careful to keep the formatting of the file as is - with no space before variable and a tab between variable and value.
	

Step 3.OPTIONAL: Edit and Batch load course subjects and research department values:

   Use this method to batch load data at install. Optionally, enter data by using Library a la Carte admin tools.
   See this documentation on entering data in the tool. http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support
   
    OPTION 1: Edit and add data
    
    edit: lib/subjects.txt 

	Edit the course subject codes to reflect the codes specific to your institution.  
	The codes in subjects.txt by default are specific to Oregon State University 
	courses.  The file format is subject code then tab then subject name, one per line; use subjects.txt as an example.
	
	edit: lib/masters.txt 
	
	Edit the master subjects to reflect the general subjects for your institution.  
	The values in masters.txt by default are specific to Oregon State University 
	departments.  The file format is one subject value per line; use masters.txt as an example.
    
    OPTION 2: Batch Load data
	   
	 run: script/batchload_data
	  
	 This will populate the subjects and masters table with the values found in lib/subjects.txt and lib/masters.txt and lib/dods.txt respectively.
 
     OPTION 3: batch load database subscription data
     Included is a list of open access databases selected by Oregon State University Librarians. 
     Required for database module: Either run this script and/or enter information through the admin tool.
     
     run sql script: /db/dods.sql
   
     Command line: mysql -u<user> -p<pass> -h mysqlserver.yourdomain.edu -D carte_production < /path/to/db/dods.sql
     PHPAdmin: Import  /db/dods.sql
	    

Step 4. OPTIONAL: Module Configuration

    OPTION 1: Enable read/write access privileges for attachment folders: public/uploads, public/photos
    Required if you plan on enabling the attachment module or the image manager to allow users to upload documents and images.
    
    Unix Command:
       chmod -R g+w /path/to/public/uploads
       chmod -R g+w /path/to/public/photos
       
    OPTION 2: Upgrade to image manager
    Required for image manager which enables users to upload and share images.
    
    edit: controllers/application_controller.rb
    
    In the uses_tiny_mce instantiation find the parameter advimage and replace with advimage_uploader
    
    OPTION 3: Configure III OPAC Variables 
    Required if you want to enable the Course Reserves and Catalog Books Module which provides a method to search for course reserves or
    catalog records and embed the information directly in a guide.
    
    NOTE: These experimental modules can only be configured for III OPACs and may not work for you due to the many different configurations
    available to III OPACS and versions of the software. 
    
    Course Reserves: 
    
    edit /lib/reserves_scraper.rb
    
    Edit the following variables, adding your own URLs and search parameters
     
     OASIS_DOMAIN = "oasis.library.oregonstate.edu" 
        The base of the URL - no http or www
     BASE_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu"
         The full URL
     SEARCH_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu/search~S13/r?SEARCH="
         The complete search URL - tip: to get this string query your catalog course reserves and copy the URL carefully removing the search query.
  
    Catalog Search: 
    
    edit /lib/catalog_scraper.rb
    
    Edit the following variables, adding your own URLs and search parameters
     
     BASE_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu"
       The full URL
     SEARCH_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu/search/?searchtype=X&searcharg="
     	The complete search URL - tip: to get this string query your catalog and copy the URL carefully removing everything after the search query.
     SEARCH_SCOPE = "&searchscope=13&SORT=D"
     	The searcg URL parameters - usually follows the query in the search URL
 
Step 5. Run the install script.

	In the root directory of the application, type:
	
	    script/install_admin
	
	This will  create the default admin user:
	
	    login: admin@your-domain.com 
	    password: adm!n
	          
Step 6. Test Library ala Carte Tool

	At this time the ala Carte tool should be installed. 
	Navigate to the root of where you installed the code:  http://yourdomain.com/
	
    Login with the default admin account created above.
	Once logged in, change the password and email address, by clicking "My Account"
	
	An admin should use the admin tools to further customize the application. Please see this documentation for more info:
	Admin FAQ: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/admin_faq
	Customize Content Types: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/content_types
	Configure Module Types: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/enable_mods
	Customize Template: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/tut_template_customization

	Customize Search: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/search_customization
	Manage Database Tables: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/config_db
	
	

Step 7. OPTIONAL: Move to production and deploy


7.1 If you have not already populated the production database:

	rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production 
	
	Optionally, you can dump the development database into the production database or
	edit database.yml and point the production environment variable to a populated database
	
7.2 Run in Production Mode

	Option 1: Set the Environment in Your .bash_login File on the Server
	The best way is to set the actual RAILS_ENV environment variable. Rails work best with the bash shell.
	
	 ~/.bashrc export RAILS_ENV="production"		
		
	Option 2: Set the Environment in Your Web Server Config File
	If you can’t set the Rails environment variable in your shell, you must look for another way to do it. 
	The next best place is in your web server configuration.	
	
	
	Option 3: Edit environment.rb
	The final way to set the environment for a shared host is to uncomment the following line at the top of environment.rb:
	
	ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'production'


7.3 Deploy to production server

################# Troubleshooting Checklist ################

Look at the Web Server Error Logs 

	One of the best places to start troubleshooting are the web server’s error logs, especially when you are initially debugging your configuration.	
	
	/log/development.log or /log/production.log
	
	Rails can’t start writing to .log files until it has launched, so Rails logging can’t help you if your initial setup has critical problems.
	File permission problems and other errors will show up in the web server’s access_log and may give you clues about what is going wrong.

Do Files Have the Correct Permissions?	

	Here are a few important files and the permissions they must have:
	• The log directory and files must be writable by the user running the FastCGI or Mongrel process. 
	• The public directory must be writable by the user running the FastCGI or Mongrel process if you are using page caching. Rails will run if the public directory is not writable but will not use caching.
	• dispatch.fcgi must be executable, but not writable by others.

Are Current Versions of Necessary Files and Requirements Present?

	Is database.yml present and correct
	Are all the gems installed and the correct version
	

Has the Database Been Migrated to the Correct Version for Your
Application?

   If you are running in production mode check that you have run the migration or initialized the production database.
 
Is the server started?
  
   You must start and stop the web server to make changes to the application

################### Upgrading from V1.3 to V1.4 ############################

Before upgrading the code you must first upgrade your databases. 
Note: The upgrading instructions assume you are using a MySQL database. 

Step 1. Upgrade databases

Note: Back up your databases before running the update file. 
    
    /db/V1.4_update.sql

Using what ever database tool you are comfortable with run the above sql file. 

Command line: mysql -u<user> -p<pass> -h mysqlserver.yourdomain.edu -D <your database> < /path/to/db/alaCarte_V1.4_update.sql
PHPAdmin: Import  /db/alaCarte_V1.4_update.sql

Step 2. Update your code base. 

Note: Backup your environment.rb and database.yml configuration, as well as any local changes and files.

Step 3. Configure Environments Variables
     Note: the configuration has changed, you will need to copy your values from environment.rb into new locations
     
	Open the configuration folder: config/
	
	3.1 Add Action Mailer variables
	
	 edit config/initializers/smpt_settings.rb
	
	 You will need to specify some additional configuration to tell ActionMailer which mail server will handle your outgoing e-mail.
	
	3.2 API Keys
	
	edit config/initializers/api_settings.rb
	Recapcha:
	Add your recaptcha API keys to the #recaptcha variables section
	
	Google:
	Add your Google API key to the #goggle variables section
	
	edit config/flick.yml
	
	Flickr Keys
	Add your flickr api keys to the yml file. 
	Be careful to keep the formatting of the file as is - with no space before variable and a tab between variable and value.
	
	
Step 4 Optional: Module Configuration

    OPTION 1: Configure Uploads and Image Manager  
	 
	If you have been using the attachment module or image upload in the librarian module:
	Copy over attachment folders: public/uploads, public/photos

	Unix Command:
	cp -a /path/to/orig/public/uploads /path/to/new/public/uploads
	cp -a /path/to/orig/public/photos /path/to/new/public/photos
	
	Enable read/write access privileges for attachment folders: public/uploads, public/photos

    Unix Command:
       chmod -R g+w /path/to/public/uploads
       chmod -R g+w /path/to/public/photos
	
	OPTION 2: Upgrade to Image Manager
	   
    edit controllers/application_controller.rb
    In the uses_tiny_mce instantiation find the parameter advimage and replace with advimage_uploader

	To upgrade alaCarte to use the Image_manager, run the rake task, move_to_image_manager.  The rake 
	task move_to_image_manager is used to create sql insert commands which will move all previously
	uploaded images from the librarian profiles into the image_manager.  The insert commands are added
	to the sql file image_manger_update.sql.  Executing this rake task and then running the sql script
	will import all of the previously uploaded images into the image_manager. 
	
	1.  run: rake move_to_image_manager
    
    2.  run: /db/image_manger_update.sql

		Using what ever database tool you are comfortable with run the above sql file. 
		
		Command line: mysql -u<user> -p<pass> -h mysqlserver.yourdomain.edu -D carte_production < /path/to/db/image_manger_update.sql
		PHPAdmin: Import  /db/image_manger_update.sql

    
    OPTION 3: Configure III OPAC Variables 
    Required if you want to enable the Course Reserves and Catalog Books Module which provides a method to search for course reserves or
    catalog records and embed the information directly in a guide.
    
    NOTE: These experimental modules can only be configured for III OPACs and may not work for you due to the many different configurations
    available to III OPACS and versions of the software. 
    
    OPTION 3.1 Course Reserves 
    
    edit /lib/reserves_scraper.rb
    
    Edit the following variables, adding your own URLs and search parameters
     
     OASIS_DOMAIN = "oasis.library.oregonstate.edu" 
        The base of the URL - no http or www
     BASE_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu"
         The full URL
     SEARCH_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu/search~S13/r?SEARCH="
         The complete search URL - tip: to get this string query your catalog course reserves and copy the URL carefully removing the search query.
  
    OPTION 3.2 Catalog Search 
    
    edit /lib/catalog_scraper.rb
    
    Edit the following variables, adding your own URLs and search parameters
     
     BASE_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu"
       The full URL
     SEARCH_URI = "http://oasis.library.oregonstate.edu/search/?searchtype=X&searcharg="
     	The complete search URL - tip: to get this string query your catalog and copy the URL carefully removing everything after the search query.
     SEARCH_SCOPE = "&searchscope=13&SORT=D"
     	The searcg URL parameters - usually follows the query in the search URL    

Step 5. OPTIONAL: Clean Unused Database Tables

	This version has removed some module types. If you have been using Library a la Carte since V1.2 or have been using the Plagiarism, Recommended Resource,
	Style Guides or Assignment Modules you should run this option to move the data into the Custom Content Module.
	 
	 To verify that you have these tables, use the following commands from the command line or use your favorite database tool:

	Connect to mysql -u<user> -p -h mysqlserver.yourdomain.edu -D <database_name>

	Once logged in, enter the following line:

		SHOW TABLES IN <database_name> LIKE ‘%_resources’;

	Check to see if the four tables (assign_resources, plag_resources, recom_resources,and style_resources) exist.  
	If you don’t have these tables, then you can skip this step.
	
	If these tables exist, 
	
	Run: : rake resource_transfer
	
	Then Run: db/delete_old_resource_tables.sql
	
	Using what ever database tool you are comfortable with run the above sql file. 

	Command line: mysql -u<user> -p -h mysqlserver.yourdomain.edu -D database_name < /path/to/db/delete_old_resource_tables.sql
	PHPAdmin: Import  /db/delete_old_resource_tables.sql
	
	
    
Step 6. Customize 
	Customization has changed.
	
	An admin should use the admin tools to further customize the application. Please see this documentation for more info:
	Admin FAQ: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/admin_faq
	Customize Content Types: http://alacarte.library.oregonstate.edu/support/content_types
